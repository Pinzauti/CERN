# CERN technical student notes
Notes on how to increase your chances at getting accepted for the technical student programme at CERN. The Technical Student Programme at CERN allows students from the Bachelor's and the Master's degree to go to work at CERN for 4-12 months for a studentship. Be sure to have a look at [careers website](https://careers.cern/) and at the [official programme page](https://careers.smartrecruiters.com/CERN/tech).

Since most of this information lay around in the internet (mostly on [r/CERN](reddit.com/r/CERN)) but in little bits everywhere, I decided to gather it all in one spot. I take no responsibility for the information here, this is just what i learned.

[Tau Bytes](https://taubytes.com/cern.html) is also a cool site/blog made by a previous summer student that lists tips about the application, cv and motivational letter that could be applied for technical as well

The fields in which you can apply are:
- applied physics;
- electrical or electronics engineering;
- general  or civil engineering; 
- IT, mathematics and robotics; 
- material and surface science;
- mechanical engineering.


Acceptance rate is pretty low, but nothing impossible. It is (much) higher for students from member states. 
This is the acceptance rate for the last years (for both selection committees) :
| Year | Applications | Selected | Success rate |
|------|--------------|----------|--------------|
| 2021 |         2565 |      187 |        7,29% |
| 2020 |         2169 |      156 |        7,19% |
| 2019 |         2505 |      143 |        5,71% |
| 2018 |         2161 |       90 |        4,16% |
| 2017 |         1248 |      222 |       17,79% |
| 2016 |         1350 |      233 |       17,26% |

You can find more detailed statistics about ethnicity, gender etc. at [CERN Annual Personnel report](https://cds.cern.ch/collection/CERN%20Annual%20Personnel%20Statistics?ln=el) at Technical Student Recruitment section.

# Preparing your application
There are two committees every year, ~~one in May and one in December~~(*that is changed from second part of 2022*) . The deadline for the committee in May is around the end of March, while the deadline for the December committee is around October. Apply for a particular selection round if you're aiming to start 1-6 months after the committee.
Take your time to prepare your application, there is no advantage in sending it first or sooner. Just be sure to send it before the deadline. 

CERN has it's own page for tips [here](https://careers.cern/tips-applying).

## Requirements
The requirements to apply for a technical student position are stated in the website, but unfortunately the requirements are not available until the applications open, so here they are:
- You are a national of a [CERN Member or Associate Member State](http://home.cern/about/member-states).
- You have completed at least 18 months of your undergraduate studies (Bachelor or Master’s) at the time of the next student selection taking place in [...]. Please note that PhD students are not eligible for this programme.
- You can stay for at least 4 and at most 12 months **remaining registered as a full-time student.**
- You have a good knowledge of English OR French.

Note that you cannot graduate or finish your studies during the technical student programme, you will need to remain enrolled.

## Your CV
A short CV that catches the eye is better than a long CV everything you did in your life in detail. A couple of pages should be enough for a student. Select the relevant experiences. As recruiters often say: "If you're enrolled in university, we can probably figure out that you did high school too". No need to specify.

Be sure to mention any relevant project you did. University assignments work too. If you have nothing to mention, do some and come back. From the recruiters perspective it helps to assess your competences and show your interests. If you did group assignments, mention that too. Other than this, supervisors search through applications using keyword search. So **use keywords for your projects**. Bullet points are a tool too.

## Recommendation letter
You can upload your recommendation letter in two ways: you upload it in the application form or you send the recommendation upload link to whoever is writing the letter for you and they upload it from there. The second way is useful when who is writing the letter doesn't want you to read it, to not influence them in writing it.
I don't think CERN cares if you use a way or the other, it is the author's preference to show it to you or not.

Ask some uni professor that knows you (better if you took an exam with them and it went well).

## Member States vs Associate Member States
To me it looks like Associate Member States nationals have a lower acceptance rate. I don't know if this is by policy or by chance.

## “elaborate briefly your experience of the chosen domain(s)”

## "Message to the recruiter" and "What is your motivation for applying for this job?"
This is where your motivational letter should go. You can find tips at [Tau Bytes](https://taubytes.com/cern/02-motivation-letter-for-cern-motivationletter.html)

## Duration
You can choose to stay 4 to 12 months, but most of the teams look for candidates that will stay 12 months. Someone gathered some data and made some stats on the studentship duration. Author: [u/super_max2](https://www.reddit.com/r/CERN/comments/kqdey9/yes_you_can_get_a_technical_student_placement/gi3zobh/) on reddit.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17505995/165913409-0886d730-e06f-48b0-9ed0-934ef61fcb2b.png)

While 12 months is the vast majority, two thirds of the contracts last less. However, **my advice is to try and be available for 12 months**, and indicate it in the application form.

# SONRU interview
After a couple of days since the closing of the application, if you did everything correctly, it comes the most scary part for many. You receive an email asking you to complete the self-video interview. In the email they tell you the questions that you will be asked. They are exactly what they tell you. Previously they had these questions but of course they are subject to change, so check what the email said.
- Briefly introduce yourself 
- Describe a project you’re proud of and why, 
- Tell about your technical/administrative strengths, 
- Why do you want to take this internship and what do you know about CERN,
- What is your ideal working environment
- Do you want to add any comment?

That's it. You get one minute to think to an answer (not recorded) and one minute to reply (obviously recorded). I was a bit nervous, and you probably will be too. But there is no need, just answer the questions.

# Interviews with the teams
Now for the hard part. After the SONRU deadline, HR send all the candidate files to the teams for the selection. 1-3 weeks after the SONRU deadline, you can be contacted by some team - typically via email - to schedule a call. 

Most of the applicants won't get contacted back. Rumors are that, if you don't get an interview your chances are slim. This seems to be false.  
From a small poll of 36 people that were selected:  
- 12 were confirmed to be selected after the interview (before the committee official selection);
- 12 took an interview and were selected afterwards;
- 12 did not take any interview and did not get contacted, and met their supervisors ony after the official selection committee. 

You can be contacted by one or more teams. While this does not mean that you're selected yet, i feel like this means that your chances are increased.


### How to prepare for the interview
Research the group and the interviewers a bit! Do your homework on what they do. Search both the names and the section, try to understand roughly what they do and what they may expect you to do for them. 

### The actual interview
Don't be nervous! They will probably be interested in you just as you're interested in them! They will introduce themselves, tell you a bit about their project and why you're needed, and try to understand if and how your skills would fit on their project and in their team. To get your skills across tell them about some relevant projects. If they are developing a kryptonite hypermagnet, tell them about that one uni project where you studied kryptonite magnets to make a time curving device. If they're developing a brainfuck interpreter, tell them more about your experience with esoteric languages and the time you wrote a turing machine simulator from scratch. Be relevant. 

# After the interview
After the interviews, you're done! The teams will communicate to the HR a list of three names. One is the main candidate, and the other two are first and second reserve candidates.  
The teams will probably not tell you if you're on the list and at which place, but they may give you some feedback.

You may be selected as main candidate by more than one team. What i gathered online is that if there is a conflict within a department, the HR or the department choose for you. Instead, if the conflict is across different departments they may let you choose. I had the chance to choose.

# Outcome
You will receive an email after the committee meeting, with one of four outcomes:
- **You are selected**. Congratulations, you did it! 
- **You are selected for more than one project.** Excellent! You will have to choose which project you want to pick. If you were not interviewed by supervisors before, they will get in touch explaining you the projects.
- **You are a reserve candidate.** You wil get an email that says something along the lines of "your application is still under consideration". You will hold this status until the first candidate either signs or fails to sign the contract. 
- **You are not selected.** It happens for most candidates, I'm sorry! Check out [what to do if you are not selected](#if-im-not-selected)

The committee takes place around the first Thursday of December/May and results are handed around 4pm-5pm CET. If you haven't heard on the same day, then chances to get selected are pretty low. You can see when the next committe takes place at [CERN calendar](https://indico.cern.ch/category/0/calendar) as "TSC-(year)"

# If I'm not selected
Retry if you don't succeed the first time! You will only get better. 

Sometimes (a lot of us) made the question "what is cern looking in the candidates?". Keep in mind, that CERN has a specific domain area and recruitment is based on the project the supervisor wants you to work on. It's not like companies where they give priority to a more well rounded overall talent and they could just teach you the missing pieces. So having the skills required for the project (which is unknown to students in order to be fair and square) is the key to getting accepted. You might be the best programmer in a language, going to hackathons, having projects and previous internships, solving 300 leetcodes per day, but if they don't relate to the CERN project, you won't get selected. Even if these could get you an interview and an offer at Google. In contrast you might have some experience in a very niche skill that CERN uses and it will be enough to get accepted. See what CERN does (open source projects), what the departments and groups do, what technologies they use and if they align with your skills and interests, then you are in a good spot. If not, prepare yourself! 


# After i'm selected
Congratulations! There are a few things you will have to do before your envolvement becomes official. With HR representatives you will proceed in steps gathering all the required documentation:
- In the first step **you will need to provide the scan of an ID with an expiration date or a passport**. Be prepared for this, if your country issues IDs without expiration date, start the process of getting a passport in advance, as it may take some time (some countries have an expedited procedure if you are in urgent need). 
- Next you will be asked to provide the signed home institute declaration. You need this signed and stamped. If you don't know who to ask, try asking the professor that wrote your reference letter, they will know!
- In the last step you will receive your contract to be signed. You will have to sign it in 7 days and upload it.

Check out the HR page for students: https://hr.web.cern.ch/technical-doctoral-and-administrative-students

# I have signed my contract! Now what?
I don't know yet! :) 
I'll update this page soon.

Two useful pages are the [Before I arrive](https://hr.web.cern.ch/before-i-arrive) page and the [Technical, Doctoral and Administrative Students](https://hr.web.cern.ch/technical-doctoral-and-administrative-students) page.


There is a post on Tau Bytes that you may find useful, even though is aimed at summer students: https://taubytes.com/cern/05-going-to-cern-information-how-to-get-to-cern.html

## Bank account
You will need a swiss bank account. Here are some resources on how to choose one: 
+ https://www.reddit.com/r/CERN/comments/sp3y74/suggestions_for_swiss_bank_account/
+ https://www.facebook.com/groups/young.at.cern/permalink/4168200349892248/

If you go for something like UBS or Credit Agricolè, most likely you'll need **two** different bank accounts, one in CHF and the other one in Euros. This means two different IBANs (CERN will pay you in the CHF one). Your consultant at the bank of your choice will explain you the situation in details.

A lot of people seem to be unsatisfied with UBS. Some people recommend BCGE, it seems like it's free for CERN people, but not everyone was able to open it.

I've opened an account with Yuh, and I'm super happy about it. It is completely free (others may charge upwards of 10 CHF/month) and has great support. 
The downside is that currently you can only open a Yuh bank account if you have another bank account in your name from one of very few countries: Switzerland, Italy, Austria, France, Germany and Liechtenstein. You will then need to activate your Yuh account by making a bank transfer from your other account to Yuh.
I know people opening a french bank account just to open Yuh.

You can then transfer CHF from Yuh to Revolut completely for free by topping up Revolut with the Yuh Mastercard, I am then able to change money to EUR in Revolut at the advantageous rate. 
As far as I know, this is not possible with many other swiss banks. 

If you want, you can use my referral for Yuh: ayi2i6

Keep in mind that CERN Marketplace is not private for CERN people: beware of frauds!

## Mobility
When you plan your stay at CERN, keep in mind that you are entitled to ask for a [CERN bike](https://sce-dep.web.cern.ch/mobility/bike-rental). This means about 10/15 minutes of commute from Saint-Genis-Pouilly, for example. 

CERN has also some [shuttle lines](https://sce-dep.web.cern.ch/cern-shuttle-service) in place. Shuttles are free for CERN workers.
