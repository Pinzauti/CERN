# CERN 

The aim of this repo is to centralise as much information about CERN as possible, which is currently scattered around the web.

You will find two files:
- [Applications](applications.md): here you can find tips and suggestions about the recruitment process.
- [Newcomers](newcomers.md): here you will find suggestions on what to do once you have arrived at CERN and answers to typical problems encountered by newcomers.
