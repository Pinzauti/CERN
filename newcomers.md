# Newcomer's Quick-Information Doc.
First of all, welcome to all new CERN students, graduates, & the likes! This document has been compiled as a collective effort to provide answers to common questions seen in any newcomer-related WhatsApp/Telegram/etc. chat and help dispel any confusion.

# Commuting in...
If you're lost on how you can manage your commute between CERN and your home or to the grocery store, here's some information on how to get some half-fares, general discounts, or yearly travel cards for your commute.

## Geneva
In Geneva, [tpg (Transports Publics Genevois)](https://www.tpg.ch/) is the responsible public transport service. Normally, you have to pay [3.- CHF](http://www.geneva.info/public-transport-tickets/) for a ticket that works for 1-hour only in zone 10 (see image below). This is normally enough time to get between point A-to-B; However, if you consider the *frequency* of your commute to-and-from CERN, this may become a hefty sum very quickly.

![Geneva transport zones](https://www.tpg.ch/sites/default/files/2021-04/t%C3%A9l%C3%A9chargement.png "Geneva transport zones")

This is where [SwissPass](https://www.swisspass.ch) comes in. SwissPass is, in essence, [a card that links to other travel card and partnered transport services](https://www.sbb.ch/en/travelcards-and-tickets/swisspass/swisspass-card.html). You first need to sign up with your e-mail in order to link to other transport services before requesting your [**customer number**](https://www.swisspass.ch/faq#common).

You have a couple of options to get your customer number. You may either...
1. Find the [closest tpg office](https://www.tpg.ch/en/purchase/sales-points/agencies) nearest to you and order your fare, while informing them about your SwissPass account and requesting to link it,
2. [Contact SwissPass](https://www.swisspass.ch/contact), where you may need to provide a valid scan of your passport/ID card and the customer number will be generated for you (Using the chat is much quicker than the contact form. It is also possible to change the language of the page on the top-right). 

With your SwissPass customer number, you can link & obtain a [weekly, monthly, or yearly fare with tpg](https://www.tpg.ch/en/purchase/your-ticket/regular-travelers) in order to save up on some needed CHF.

**Do note that, sometimes, your municipality may have discounts for certain fares!** These can be found once you log in on the page and found under "Offers of my municipality", or as a pop-up when viewing the webshop (see red boxes below).

![TPG Webshop 'Offers of my municipality'](https://codimd.web.cern.ch/uploads/upload_72e04eaf21959aad2dbc1321ad18a44b.png)


## Saint-Genis-Pouilly

The french side is served by TPG as well (zone 250). The bus service is not great but doable.

The price if you stay inside zone 250 is CHF 1.60, if you cross the border a ticket is CHF 4.50. See below for the **saut de puce transfrontalier**.

If you just need to go from the last stop in France (Saint-Genis Porte de France) to the first stop in Switzerland (Meyrin CERN) and vice versa, you can buy a **saut de puce transfrontalier** ticket that costs less, CHF 2.30. The ticket is bought from [LemanPass](https://www.lemanpass.com/tarifs/) but I still haven't figured out why. (*to be fair, i didnt have a proper look. If you do, please add more info*)

[Bus 68](https://wex-qual.tpg.ch/fr/lignes/68) takes you from Meyrin to the shopping mall in Thoiry (France) going through Saint-Genis.

[Bus 66](https://wex-qual.tpg.ch/fr/lignes/66) takes you from the airport to the Thoiry shopping mall through Fernay, Prevessin and Saint-Genis. 

Bus 66 also stops outside CERN Prevessin. So to go there you may take the bus. If you live close to the Schumann hostel, a CERN shuttle stops there and takes you both to Meyrin and Prevessin sites.

For the rest, get a bike to go to most places (CERN can give you one for free), and get a car to go to the rest of places.

# Useful Tools

## E-groups Search Tool
A handy tool to help you find people and lists within CERN:
- [E-groups Search](https://e-groups.cern.ch/e-groups/EgroupsSearchForm.do)

## Essential CERN Links

As a newcomer, these are some of the most important links you might need:

- **Phonebook**: 
  - [Search for contacts at CERN](https://phonebook.cern.ch/search)
  
- **EDH (Electronic Document Handling)**:
  - [EDH Portal](https://edh.cern.ch/Desktop/dir.jsp) - Use this to manage administrative tasks. For instance, you can request vacations, monitor days off taken by your team, and more.
  
- **Account Management**: 
  - [Manage your CERN account](https://account.cern.ch/account/)
  
- **CERN Maps**: 
  - [Navigate around CERN with this map tool](https://maps.cern.ch/)

# CERN Contract / Attestation

Did your landlord ask for your CERN contract? Is your new bank provider requiring it as some sort of attestation for opening a swiss bank account? [**CERN EDH** provides easy access to your contract](https://hrt.cern.ch/hrt/EmploymentAttestation).

You can select the **period** that you require the attestation for, and also whether you want it in ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ English or ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡· French. Simple enough!

# Clubs @ CERN

So, you wanna join your fellow colleagues in some kind of hobby within the CERN confinements? Say no more! [At CERN you can join clubs that specialize in any kind of activity](https://staff-association.web.cern.ch/unite/clubs)! 

The more popular clubs include:

- Fitness
- Skiing (during the winter)
- Climbing
- Music
- Jazz
- Cinema
- Martial Arts

There are also other clubs, however, some of them might have a huge lack of activity and/or outdated webpages. If that is the case, always make sure to send an e-mail to the said club.

# Banking
To receive your CERN salary you will need a swiss IBAN. Many options are available, also depending if you live in Switzerland or in France.

**This is a draft, add more info as you discover them.**


### UBS
UBS is a swiss bank that has an office inside CERN. Because of this, opening an account there is very convenient. They are, most likely, already familiar with your situation, and they are there to help you set up your account. You need to get an appointment with them to open an account.

UBS has very convenient options to have a CHF account, an EUR account, many kinds of credit and debit cards. 

Many people seem unsatisfied with UBS, both because of the pricing and because of some policies.

- You will have 6 months free if you are a new customer.
- If you are under 22 (or a student under 30), you can get the Young banking package, which offers the services for free.

Alternatives exist.

### BCGE 
BCGE is a less popular option, both because they don't have an office inside of CERN (but many around Geneva, including Meyrin) and because, being a not so popular choice, they may not be fully aware of the situation of CERN employees. However, Alban Redzepi at the [main Ile branch in Bel-Air](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Agence+BCGE+Ile/@46.205293,6.1415291,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x478c6528561f6eef:0xaf7ca5b7eef384df!8m2!3d46.2052893!4d6.144104!16s%2Fg%2F11cs1dttw8?entry=ttu) (0228097545) is familiar with CERN new starters and can sort you out. If you don't have a Swiss address yet you can start with an international account then swap (so 25CHF for the first 3 months). A [partnership with the staff association exists](https://staff-association.web.cern.ch/unite/partnership/bcge) that gives you better rates (if you live in Switzerland, the business account and debit card is free, with Staff Association membrship - 50chf/year). For more info, contact: staff.association@cern.ch 

### YUH
Yuh is a fintech bank. It is free and operated by SwissQuote and PostFinance. 
Opening an account can be really quick (in a day), provided you have all the required documents.
It has an excellent phone customer service. Beware that the phone service is a +41 number, so you will need to be able to call Switzerland to use it. 
You do not need to have a swiss residence to open an account, but you need to provide proof that you live in either **Switzerland, Italy, Austria, France, Germany and Liechtenstein**.

**Catch**: to open a Yuh account you need to activate it by sending a bank transfer to your YUH account from an account in your name, that must have an IBAN from one of these countries: **Switzerland, Italy, Austria, France, Germany and Liechtenstein**. Yuh will also ask you send them your french fiscal number if you live in France.


### Neon
Neon is a fintech bank. To be investigated, but someone said that Neon requires a Swiss permit type B or C, which you don't get as a CERN employee. Feel free to add more info if you have more. Neon also requires you to have a Swiss address and be exclusively tax domiciled in Switzerland, further complicating its use for CERN members.

### Revolut
If you live in Switzerland, when you move you can open an account with Revolut with a Swiss IBAN. In revolut you benefit from decent currency exchange rates, that can be brought to zero if you pay a subscription. If you live in France, you will not be able to get the CHxxxx IBAN.
Using Revolut can still be convenient to pay in euros if you live in France. You can top up your Revolut account in different ways.

## Money transfer services
Transfering money between a Swiss account and an European account is often charged a lot. Not only you have to pay to send a bank transfer outside Switzerland, but sometimes *handling fees* are charged you. It happened to me that I was charged 25 CHF to transfer from Yuh to Revolut. To avoid paying these fees, money transfer services exist.

### Wise
Wise allows you to maintain CHF and EUR balances, and charges 0.4% for the conversion. But, if you're smart, Wise can be used as an intermediary to transfer money between your bank and Revolut - the trick is to use the Wise card to top up your Revolut account. Bank account (CHF) --(transfer)--> Wise (CHF) --(card)--> Revolut (CHF) --(convert for free up to 1000EUR per month)--> Revolut EUR.

### Ibani
Ibani works like a pipe that pipes money from a bank account to another, converting it in another currency at market rates in the process.
In my case, I have a Swiss iban that i can transfer money to at no expense, Ibani is then set up to convert this money, as soon as it receives it, to EUR and send them towards my revolut. They charge a fee of 0.4%, including money conversion. When I looked it up, this was the best rate available in general to convert money (Revolut charges you 1% on a free plan).

# Swiss/French card request process

Whether you live on the Swiss or the French side, you must apply for **both** cards!

## Swiss card process

For the Swiss card, CERN should already have all the needed documentation from your contract preparation phase. Once you register your permanent address in EDH, they will start the process automatically.

[CERN's official Swiss card guide](https://admin-eguide.web.cern.ch/en/procedure/swiss-cards)

## French card process

The request process for the French card is more involved, requiring copies of documents and filled-in forms to be dropped off physically.

You should find all the requirements in [CERN's official French card guide](https://admin-eguide.web.cern.ch/en/procedure/french-cards).

## Printing stuff at CERN

You can send an email with your document to Mail2Print.Service@cern.ch, which will reply with a list of available printers near you. Pick one and go collect your printout.

## Photo booths

You'll need to provide 3 passport-format photos with your request for the French card. There are several photo booths in the area that can be used for this matter.

### Meyrin Site

- Located inside the Building 500
- 14 CHF for 6 photos

# Unsorted information
- There are certain places where you can get a discount for just showing your CERN badge (or having a contract with CERN <- this is unverified), such as recently: Intersport has a 10% discount & Go Sport had (has?) 15% off for your CERN badge, on articles not already on sale

# Fixing a bike

If you have a CERN bike, the bike shop will fix it for you. 

If you want to fix your own bike (even if you don't know how), there is a shared bike workshop in Ferney Voltaire: https://velorution-paysdegex.fr/


# Renting/borrowing objects
